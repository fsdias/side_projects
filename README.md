# Side Projects

This is a collection of small, self-contained projects where I explore new concepts, experiment with different technologies, and share what I learn along the way. 

Each project is a focused, bite-sized task—whether it’s testing a new library, solving a coding challenge, or building a tiny tool. The goal? Learn by doing, document the process, and maybe help someone else in the process.

Feel free to browse, fork, or suggest improvements.
